constraints
---

Another tedious joy of third world living.
To be specific, I need a copy of the [exp/constraints][original] module, but little else of `exp`'s contents. Because I don't have reliable internet, and go forces you to manage dependencies online/adopt a language-specific environment to benefit from it's new `work` feature, it becomes necessary to hold on to extra copies of stuff
